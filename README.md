In Page Lookup is an add-on that lets you look up a word on any page in the same page as you have highlighted.  

To look up a word on Wikipedia – Just highlight the word and `click Ctrl+Shift+1` (`Command+Shift+1` on mac) and an overlay of the Wikipedia article will appear as an in-page overlay.

To look up a word on Wiktionary – Just highlight the word and click `Ctrl+Shift+2` (`Command+Shift+2` on mac) and an overlay of the Wiktionary article will appear as an in-page overlay.

To close the overlay, `click Ctrl+Shift+~` (`Command+Shift+~` on mac) (the key to the left of the '1' key if you have a different keyboard that doesn't have the \`/~ key)
